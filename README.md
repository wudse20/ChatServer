# ChatServer
A simple chat server.

## Running the client
To run the client you first have to install the dependencies. This only has to be done once. Don't want to run your own instance of the client? Use [this](chat.skorup.se)!

### Installing dependencies
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Running the webpage
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running the server
```
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew run
```
